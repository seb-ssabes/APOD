  NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)
</h1>

# Introduction
I wanted to build a project where I could practice working with and fetching data from REST APIs. I chose NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API because it combines technology with the fascinating world of astronomy. This project allowed me to explore API integration while showcasing stunning images of our universe.

# About the App
APOD lets you browse NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day from today all the way back to June 20, 1995. You can:

- **View high-resolution images** with a full-screen feature for better detail.
- **Search by date** to find a specific day's APOD.
- **Search by keywords** to find images based on words in the title, explanation, or copyright.
- **Explore the archive** to see an overview of recent APODs at a glance.

# Acknowledgments

This project serves as an independent way to explore and interact with APOD’s content while fully respecting its original sources. A huge thanks to NASA and the APOD team, especially Robert Nemiroff and Jerry Bonnell, for curating and maintaining this extraordinary archive of space imagery.
